# Professional-README-Generator
You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.


## About

This application allows developers to quickly and efficiently create professional README.md files using the command line. Using the Inquirer package, users are prompted with questions pertaining to the project. With these answers, the application will generate an organized README.md file, giving them more time and energy to focus on the development process.

## Application

This application is run completely through the command-line.

Features include:

* Prompts for name, year, title, description, installation, instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* Adds proper badge to top of generated README.md based upon user response
* Adds proper license description to generated README.md based upon user response
* Github username submitted by user includes a link to the user's Github profile

Below, there is a video walkthrough of the functionality of the application. There are also screenshots of the final terminal result, and the final appearence of the sample README.md in its entirety.
